approach: neural network models of speeded decsiison making in a *varaiational Bayesian framework*. 
- to be fitted to trial-level RT datasets + rawa vissual stimuli. 

Background: 
- evidence accumulation models (EAMs)
	- linear ballistic accumulator (LBA)
	- diffusion frameworks

Shortcoming: 
- highly abstracted models that inform limitedly about the cognitive process (one dimension only)
- This is simple for simple tasks but much more challenging wiht more complex stimuli. 
	- model-based approaches needed. 

New model: 
**Neural accumulator model** to jointly explain RT, choice, and raw visual stimulus data from speeded DM tasks. 
- input = whatever is available for the participants
- output = inference on the drift rate to best explain RT and choice data.
