  abstract = {Summary  Replay of behavioral sequences in the hippocampus during sharp wave ripple complexes (SWRs) provides a potential mechanism for memory consolidation and the learning of knowledge structures. Current hypotheses imply that replay should straightforwardly reflect recent experience. However, we find these hypotheses to be incompatible with the content of replay on a task with two distinct behavioral sequences (A and B). We observed forward and backward replay of B even when rats had been performing A for {$>$}10 min. Furthermore, replay of nonlocal sequence B occurred more often when B was infrequently experienced. Neither forward nor backward sequences preferentially represented highly experienced trajectories withina session. Additionally, we observed the construction of never-experienced novel-path sequences. These observations challenge the idea that sequence activation during SWRs is a simple replay of recent experience. Instead, replay reflected all physically available trajectories within the environment, suggesting a potential role in active learning and maintenance of the cognitive map.},

  abstract = {Effective behavior often requires synchronizing our actions with changes in the environment. Rhythmic changes in the environment are easy to predict, and we can readily time our actions to them. Yet, how the brain encodes and maintains rhythms is not known. Here, we trained primates to internally maintain rhythms of different tempos and performed large-scale recordings of neuronal activity across the sensory-motor hierarchy. Results show that maintaining rhythms engages multiple brain areas, including visual, parietal, premotor, prefrontal, and hippocampal regions. Each recorded area displayed oscillations in firing rates and oscillations in broadband local field potential power that reflected the temporal and spatial characteristics of an internal metronome, which flexibly encoded fast, medium, and slow tempos. The presence of widespread metronome-related activity, in the absence of stimuli and motor activity, suggests that internal simulation of stimuli and actions underlies timekeeping and rhythm maintenance.           ,              To keep a rhythm, the brain uses an internal dynamic simulation that recreates the stimuli and actions that define such rhythm.},

  abstract = {To make decisions, animals must evaluate outcomes of candidate choices by accessing memories of relevant experiences. Recent theories suggest that phenomena of habits and compulsion can be reinterpreted as selectively omitting such computations. Yet little is known about the more granular question of which specific experiences are considered or ignored during deliberation, which ultimately governs decisions. Here, we propose a normative theory to predict not just whether but which memories should be accessed at each time to enable the most rewarding future decisions. Using nonlocal "replay" of spatial locations in hippocampus as a window into memory access, we simulate a spatial navigation task where an agent accesses memories of locations sequentially, in order of the expected utility of the computation: how much more reward would be earned due to better choices. We show that our theory offers a unifying account of a large range of hitherto disconnected findings in the place cell literature such as the balance of forward and reverse replay, biases in the replayed content, and effects of experience. We suggest that the various types of nonlocal events during behavior and rest reflect different instances of a single choice evaluation operation, unifying seemingly disparate proposed functions of replay including planning, learning and consolidation, and whose dysfunction may explain issues like rumination and craving.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks currently provide the best models of biological vision. However, their decision behavior, including the facts that they are deterministic and use equal number of computations for easy and difficult stimuli, differs markedly from human decision-making, thus limiting their applicability as models of human perceptual behavior. Here we develop a new neural network, RTNet, that generates stochastic decisions and human-like response time (RT) distributions, and also reproduces all foundational features of human accuracy, RT, and confidence. To test RTNet's ability to predict human behavior on novel images, we collected accuracy, RT, and confidence data from 60 human subjects performing a digit discrimination task. We found that the accuracy, RT, and confidence produced by RTNet for individual novel images correlated with the same quantities produced by human subjects. Critically, human subjects who were more similar to the average human performance were also found to be closer to RTNet's predictions. Overall, RTNet is a promising model of human response times that exhibits the critical signatures of perceptual decision making.},

We trained pattern classifiers on the MEG activity elicited by direct presentation of the visual objects alone and tested these classifiers on activity recorded during periods when no object was presented. During these object-free periods, the brain spontaneously visited representations of approximately four objects in fast sequences lasting on the order of 120ms. These sequences followed backward trajectories along the permissible paths in the task. Thus, spontaneous fast sequential representation of states can be measured non-invasively in humans, and these sequences may be a fundamental feature of neural computation across tasks.},
