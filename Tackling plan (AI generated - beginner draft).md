# Getting Versed in RNNs for Modeling Cognition and Motor Control

This structured approach aims to help you get familiar with the literature on using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for modeling cognition and motor control within a week. It covers core topics and exploratory topics, with each topic accompanied by an example paper and potential extensions.

## Core Topics

### 1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

**Introduction:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data, making them well-suited for tasks like language modeling, speech recognition, and time series analysis. They maintain an internal state that captures information from previous inputs, allowing them to model temporal dependencies.

- Example Paper: "Long Short-Term Memory" by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)
- Extensions: Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), Bidirectional RNNs, Attention Mechanisms

### 2. Sequence-to-Sequence Models

**Introduction:** Sequence-to-sequence models are a class of neural network architectures that learn to map input sequences to output sequences, making them useful for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and dialogue systems. They typically consist of an encoder that processes the input sequence and a decoder that generates the output sequence.

- Example Paper: "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" by Sutskever et al. (2014)
- Extensions: Encoder-Decoder Architectures, Attention Mechanisms, Transformers

### 3. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

**Introduction:** Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of generative model that learn to encode data into a latent space and then decode from that latent space to reconstruct the original data. They are particularly useful for learning disentangled representations and generating new samples from the learned distribution.

- Example Paper: "Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes" by Kingma and Welling (2014)
- Extensions: Conditional VAEs, Disentangled Representations, Hierarchical VAEs

### 4. Deep Variational Bayes Filters

**Introduction:** Deep Variational Bayes Filters are a class of models that combine deep learning with state-space models and variational inference. They can learn to infer the latent state of a dynamical system from raw data, making them useful for tasks like time series forecasting, system identification, and control.

- Example Paper: "Deep Variational Bayes Filters: Unsupervised Learning of State Space Models from Raw Data" by Karl et al. (2017)
- Extensions: Structured Inference Networks, Amortized Inference, Particle Filters

## Exploratory Topics

### 1. Cognitive Modeling with RNNs

**Introduction:** Cognitive modeling with RNNs involves using recurrent neural networks to model various aspects of human cognition, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. This can provide insights into the computational principles underlying cognitive processes and help develop more human-like artificial intelligence systems.

- Example Paper: "Using Recurrent Neural Networks to Model Compositionality in Human Multi-Task Rule Learning" by Overlan et al. (2017)
- Extensions: Inductive Biases, Systematic Generalization, Meta-Learning

### 2. Motor Control with RNNs

**Introduction:** Motor control with RNNs involves using recurrent neural networks to model and control the movement of robotic systems or simulated agents. This can be achieved through reinforcement learning, imitation learning, or other techniques, and has applications in robotics, prosthetics, and virtual environments.

- Example Paper: "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation with Asynchronous Off-Policy Updates" by Gu et al. (2017)
- Extensions: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, Model-Based Reinforcement Learning

### 3. Interpretability and Explainability of RNNs

**Introduction:** Interpretability and explainability of RNNs involve developing techniques to understand and explain the internal representations and decision-making processes of recurrent neural networks. This can help build trust in these systems and provide insights into how they model temporal data.

- Example Paper: "Towards Interpretable Recurrent Neural Networks" by Arras et al. (2019)
- Extensions: Attention Visualization, Saliency Maps, Concept Activation Vectors

### 4. Bayesian RNNs and Uncertainty Estimation

**Introduction:** Bayesian RNNs and uncertainty estimation involve incorporating Bayesian principles into recurrent neural networks, allowing them to capture and quantify uncertainties in their predictions. This can be useful in safety-critical applications or when dealing with noisy or incomplete data.

- Example Paper: "Bayesian Recurrent Neural Networks" by Fortunato et al. (2018)
- Extensions: Variational Inference, Dropout Uncertainty, Ensemble Methods
