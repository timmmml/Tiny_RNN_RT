Recap from Marcelo's meeting, we agreed that the first steps is two experiment with Task-DyVA implementation on the Bartolo dataset. 

At this stage, there are two things to be done. 
1. [x] implement the Task-DyVA by its specs from the paper. 
	- [ ] debug the initial implementation with simulated data
2. [ ] find the Bartolo dataset and do a batch of initial experimentation/exploration. 

Let's start with the first one for it helps to first understand model in a functional manner.
